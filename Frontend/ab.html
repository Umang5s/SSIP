                    The full form of ITI is Industrial Training Institute and it is a government training organization
                    responsible for providing high school students with industry-related education. At the same time,
                    some trades can still be applied after the 8th grade. Specifically, these institutes are set up to
                    offer technical information to students who have just passed the 10th level and are interested in
                    gaining some technical knowledge rather than higher education. ITI is established by the
                    Directorate-General for Employment and Training(DGET), the Ministry of skills development and
                    entrepreneurship and the government of the union to provide training in different trades.
